<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The first time I ever thought about becoming a programmer dates back to the middle school years, when I had to decide what was gonna be 
  the direction of my life basically. I would have loved to become a computer user, you know developing games, solving problems and such. 
  But then the harsh reality hit me full force, so since i wasn't that good at math they told me that I shouldn't be studying IT because otherwise
  I would have failed all my classes and lessons and such (In Italy at the end of the school year if you fail you'll be left in the previous year class,
  repeating all the same subjects and basically pushing your life back for a full year). So I forfeited this dream and decided to see what life was gonna
  giving me.

<p>Almost twenty years later I find myself in a job that I like very much, but it requires lots of sacrifices (I work as a CS assistant at an international
  airport) like living my life in a 24/7 schedule routine that gets disclosed every couple of weeks, so I basically live my life from two weeks to the next.
  Moneywise it's not that bad, but it could definitely be better and i'm sure with the ongoing crisis it will get worse.

<p>So in Novemer 2023 I was visiting a friend who lives in Japan. He is a full time programmer and works remotely most of the time, and as I commented on that,
  wishing I could work remotely from home and earn as much as he do he asked me: "why don't you study something too?", and when I replied him that I can't just quit my job
  and go to a programming school, (not even counting the fact that I'd have to pay huge sums of money for such a course) he pulled out the revolutionary item:
  UDEMY.
  There were a few discounts on different courses, such as this one (The complete 2023 Web development Bootcamp by Angela Yu) and I saw it really costed
  a risible amount of money.

  And now here I am, learning how to code stuff.
