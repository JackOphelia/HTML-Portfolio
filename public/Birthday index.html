<p>Okay now I need you all to console me, so please bring in the following order:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ponchake and all the other gattinis (especially Sborflo but mostly Chake)
        <ul>
            <li>If Chake or gattinis are unavailable pics will be mandatory</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Pokemon cards</li>
    <li>Your presence at my place, right about now</li>
    <li>Some pancakes (the food)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also these songs will be played throughout the night:</p>
