<h1>My three favourite movies</h1>
<h2>A brief list of my favourite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Independence Day</h3>
<p>I'm always wondering why I love this movie so much, probably because of my childhood i guess, but it's some sort of comfort movie</p>
<h3>I, Robot</h3>
<p> I love this movie for its atmosphere, the philosophy behind the Three Laws of Robotics and the evolution of human/robot relationships</p>
<h3>The Great Gatsby</h3>
<p>That's the story that always breaks my heart, seeing how Gatsby's life was controlled by his unrequited love for Daisy is always heartbreaking.</p>
